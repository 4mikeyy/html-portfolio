  not honest dude you can't work everyday with same feeling oh I am so determined why can't humans be honest ,they need a job 
  to earn money because money brings you happiness it can't be brought by working hard LOL! just imagine even if you work hard and you
  won't get paid how's that, will you work in that company or field -heLL NOOO! people lie to get jobs and they feel proud about it
  I have a friend who lied in an japanese interview HE doesn't know anything about programming, he failed in more than 2 subjects,copy pasted 
  someone's project in his resume and by hearted everything, this is a world full of lies and idk how can people get away just by lying.

  How there's so much crime in every country, city, state why god is not protecting those people, yk the biggest problem with human is that they believe 
  anything ->they make every celebrity as their idols and follow them like fucking Dogs,  that does this so oh that's why he/she is so gorgeous
